## How to use

In your Terminal app, go to the folder where this file is.
You can easily do that by typing `cd ` (with a trailing space), and then dragging the folder into the terminal.

Then start elm reactor:

```sh
elm-reactor
```

Then open your web browser to [http://localhost:8000/Main.elm](http://localhost:8000/Main.elm)
Whenever you reload the page, the Elm files will be recompiled (and will show you if there are any errors).
